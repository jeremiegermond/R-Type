{\bfseries{raylib is a simple and easy-\/to-\/use library to enjoy videogames programming.}}

raylib is highly inspired by Borland BGI graphics lib and by XNA framework and it\textquotesingle{}s specially well suited for prototyping, tooling, graphical applications, embedded systems and education.

{\itshape NOTE for ADVENTURERS\+: raylib is a programming library to enjoy videogames programming; no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no debug button... just coding in the most pure spartan-\/programmers way.}

raylib has been developed on Windows platform using \href{https://notepad-plus-plus.org/}{\texttt{ Notepad++}} and \href{https://www.mingw-w64.org/}{\texttt{ Min\+GW GCC}} compiler but it can be used with other IDEs on multiple platforms.

\href{https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/tree/master/projects}{\texttt{ Projects directory}} contains several ready-\/to-\/use {\bfseries{project templates}} to build raylib and code examples with multiple IDEs.

{\itshape Note that there are lots of IDEs supported, some of the provided templates could require some review, so please, if you find some issue with a template or you think they could be improved, feel free to send a PR or open a related issue.}\hypertarget{md_build__deps_raylib_src_README_autotoc_md90}{}\doxysubsection{learning and docs}\label{md_build__deps_raylib_src_README_autotoc_md90}
raylib is designed to be learned using \href{https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/tree/master/examples}{\texttt{ the examples}} as the main reference. There is no standard API documentation but there is a \href{https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{cheatsheet}}}} containing all the functions available on the library a short description of each one of them, input parameters and result value names should be intuitive enough to understand how each function works.

Some additional documentation about raylib design can be found in raylib Git\+Hub Wiki. Here are the relevant links\+:
